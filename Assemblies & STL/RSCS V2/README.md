# RSCS V2 Beta

This is a work in progress, please report any issues

for the RSCS V2 to fit you will need to print the latest version of the bed support parts. 
use one piece bed support, which replaces lmk10luu bracket and leadscrew support bracket. 

manual will be updated later as will the main cad
